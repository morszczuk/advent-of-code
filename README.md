## Let's help Santa deliver his presents, shall we?

As a kid, the most important moment of Christmas was the Santa's visit. Now we are all grown-up and professional, forgetting about the magic of little moments... Wait a minute, now we have the power to actually help Santa visit the children all around the world!

Santa's having some troubles, which are well documented on the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) website. The task is to solve quizes and help Santa move in his journey. It's so much fun!

Solutions are written in Ruby. Star - solution has been found, snowflake - not yet!
